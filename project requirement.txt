Project Title: Real-Time Cricket Auction 
EngineConcept: A high-speed, 20-user live auction where captains bid via mobile devices and results are shown on a centralized big screen.
1. System Requirements & LogicTotal Budget: 110 Points per Captain.Squad Size: Exactly 11 players.Base Price: 5 Points per player.
The "Safety" Rule: $Max\;Bid = Current\;Purse - (Remaining\;Slots \times 5)$.Bidding Mechanism: * Server-side countdown timer (e.g., 20 seconds).Any valid bid resets the timer to its original value.When the timer hits 0, the player is automatically marked as SOLD.2. Architecture & Tech StackProtocol: WebSockets (Socket.io) for sub-second latency.Backend: Node.js with Express.Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (to store player/team data).Frontend: React or Next.js (Optimized for mobile-first for Captains).3. Interface ModulesA. The Big Screen (Stadium View)Visuals: Large player photo, name, category, and career stats.Live Data: Current high bid amount and the name of the leading Team.The Timer: A giant, color-coded countdown (Green -> Yellow -> Red).Event Log: A ticker at the bottom showing the last few sold players.B. The Captain's App (Mobile)Authentication: Secure login via Team ID and 4-digit PIN.Bid Controller: A large "+" button showing the next valid bid amount.Live Budgeting: Real-time display of "Current Points" and "Maximum Allowable Bid."Roster Tracker: Progress bar showing how many of the 11 slots are filled.C. The Admin Panel & Data FeederFeeder Form: Bulk CSV upload or manual entry for players (photo, name, stats).Auction Control: Start/Pause/Resume buttons for the timer.Undo/Correction: Ability to rollback a bid or manually assign a player if a user loses connection.Health Monitor: A dashboard showing which of the 20 captains are currently online.4. User Journey (Step-by-Step)Setup: Admin uploads player data and generates 20 Captain PINs.Login: Captains arrive, scan a QR code, and log in on their phones.Initiation: Admin pushes "Player 1" to the floor.The War: Captains bid; each bid resets the timer. The Big Screen pulses with every new high bid.Completion: Timer hits zero. Server deducts points, assigns the player, and the Big Screen plays a "SOLD" animation.Cycle: Admin selects the next player until all rosters are full or points are exhausted.5. Implementation RoadmapMilestone 1: Build the Data Feeder and Database schema.Milestone 2: Set up the WebSocket server to sync a simple "counter" across 20 devices.Milestone 3: Integrate the "Maximum Bid" validation logic.Milestone 4: Design the Big Screen UI and "Sold" animations.Milestone 5: Stress test with 20 devices on a local Wi-Fi network.
